# pokedex

 Hello! If you are reading this, you might be interested on how to make a pokedex. I am currently working on one, so feel free to fork one  or request to contribute to the program. In the following content will be including some of the describtion on what my code is about.
 
 There are two main class : M.java & countPokemons.java (both of them are just programs to read the amount of pokemon in the api)
 
 countPokemons is a program with regular for loop to operate, while M is using thread.
 
 To compile these program you have to connect with json jar file which will look like the code below:
 
 javac -cp java-json.jar.; FILENAME.java
 
 While to run it:
 
 java -cp java-json.jar.; FILENAME
 
 if you would like to output what you print on your cmd to txt file, you can do the following code instead of the one above:
 
 java -cp java-json.jar.; FILENAME >TEXTFILENAME.txt
 
 try this:
